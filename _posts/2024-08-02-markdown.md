## Headings

To create a heading, add one to six <kbd>#</kbd> symbols before your heading text. The number of <kbd>#</kbd> you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

```markdown
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
```

## Styling text

You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and `.md` files.

| Style | Syntax | Keyboard shortcut | Example | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bold | `** **` or `__ __`| <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> (Windows/Linux) | `**This is bold text**` | **This is bold text** |
| Italic | `* *` or `_ _`     | <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux) | `_This text is italicized_` | _This text is italicized_ |
| Strikethrough | `~~ ~~` | None | `~~This was mistaken text~~` | ~~This was mistaken text~~ |
| Bold and nested italic | `** **` and `_ _` | None | `**This text is _extremely_ important**` | **This text is _extremely_ important** |
| All bold and italic | `*** ***` | None | `***All this text is important***` | ***All this text is important*** | <!-- markdownlint-disable-line emphasis-style -->
| Subscript | `<sub> </sub>` | None | `This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text` | This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text |
| Superscript | `<sup> </sup>` | None | `This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text` | This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text |

## Quoting text

You can quote text with a <kbd>></kbd>.

Example:

```markdown
Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote
```

Output:

Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote


Quoted text is indented, with a different type color.

## Quoting code

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

Example:

```markdown
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```

Output:

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

Example:

````markdown
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
````

Output:

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

## Writing expressions

In line $`\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2`$

Block

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
```
